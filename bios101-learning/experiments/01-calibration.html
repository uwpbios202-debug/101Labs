Sometimes I am surprised that my score is lower than expected, even though I believed I understood the material while studying and during the test. Other times, I feel unsure about my performance and yet still receive a reasonable grade. This mismatch between how confident I feel and how I actually perform has made me realize that judging my own learning is difficult. I can tell when I studied hard, but I am not always able to accurately evaluate whether my understanding is strong enough to lead to good exam results."</p>
