# Learning Objectives

By interacting with this prototype, students should be able to:

1. Explain how peptide bonds form via dehydration reactions
2. Distinguish primary, secondary, and tertiary protein structure
3. Describe the role of hydrogen bonding in secondary structure
4. Explain why hydrophobic residues are buried in protein cores
5. Predict how amino acid composition affects protein stability
