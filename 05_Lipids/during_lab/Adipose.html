    <h1>Adipose Tissue Lab: Structure, Function & Energy Storage</h1>

    <!-- 1. LAB PURPOSE -->
    <!-- ========================= -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why This Lab Exists</h2>
        <p>
            This lab trains you to connect <strong>microscopic structure</strong> to
            <strong>biological function</strong>. Adipose tissue is not just “fat” — it is a
            specialized tissue critical for energy balance, protection, and thermal regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of this exercise, you should be able to look at a slide and immediately
            recognize adipose tissue <em>and explain why it looks the way it does</em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. GOALS (METACOGNITIVE PRIMING) -->

            <li>Describe the structure of an adipose cell</li>
            <li>Explain how structure supports energy storage</li>

            <li>Encode visual memory through drawing</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Pause:</strong> Before moving on, ask yourself:<br>
            “What would success look like by the end of this lab?”
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ========================= -->
    <!-- 3. BACKGROUND: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW FIRST -->
    <!-- ========================= -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Background: What Adipose Tissue Is and What It Does</h2>

        <p>
            The major function of fat is <strong>long-term energy storage</strong>. In humans and other
            mammals, fat is stored in <strong>adipose tissue</strong>, which consists of large groups of
            specialized cells called <strong>adipocytes</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each adipose cell is almost completely filled by a single, large
            <strong>fat (lipid) droplet</strong> stored inside a vesicle. This droplet contains a
            huge number of fat molecules (primarily triglycerides). Because this droplet
            occupies most of the cell’s volume, the cytoplasm forms only a thin rim and the
            <strong>nucleus is pushed to the edge of the cell</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the body needs energy—such as between meals or during prolonged activity—
            adipose cells <strong>hydrolyze their stored fats</strong> and release
            <strong>fatty acids into the bloodstream</strong>, where they can be used by other tissues.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to energy storage, adipose tissue also:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cushions and protects vital organs such as the heart and kidneys</li>
            <li>Insulates the body to reduce heat loss</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In adults, the <strong>number of adipose cells is generally fixed</strong> because these cells
            do not readily divide. Changes in body fat are therefore primarily due to changes
            in the <em>size</em> of adipose cells, not their number.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ========================= -->
    <!-- 4. TRANSLATING FUNCTION → STRUCTURE -->
    <!-- ========================= -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>From Function to Structure: Think Like a Biologist</h2>

        <p>
            Before looking at the slide, translate what you just read into
            <strong>structural expectations</strong>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a cell’s main job is to store fat, how much space should organelles take up?</li>
            <li>What would happen to the nucleus if one large droplet fills the cell?</li>
            <li>What might fat droplets look like after chemical slide preparation?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> During slide preparation, fats are often dissolved and removed.
            This means fat droplets may appear as <em>empty or clear spaces</em> under the microscope.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ========================= -->
    <!-- 5. BEFORE YOU VIEW THE SLIDE (NOW GROUNDED) -->
    <!-- ========================= -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Before You View the Slide: Informed Prediction</h2>

        <p>
            Now that you understand the function and structure of adipose tissue,
            make a prediction about what you expect to see under the microscope.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your prediction should address:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Overall appearance of the tissue</li>
            <li>Size and shape of individual cells</li>
            <li>Location of nuclei</li>
            <li>Presence of large clear spaces</li>
        </ul>

        <textarea
            placeholder="Based on the background information, describe what adipose tissue should look like under the microscope and explain why."></textarea>

        <p>
            <strong>Metacognitive check:</strong>
            Are you predicting based on evidence from the text, or guessing?
            If guessing, reread the background before proceeding.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ========================= -->
    <!-- 4. GUIDED SLIDE VIEWING -->
    <!-- ========================= -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>While Viewing the Microscope Slide</h2>
        <p>As you examine the slide, actively look for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Large, empty-appearing spaces (fat droplets removed during slide prep)</li>
            <li>Thin rims of cytoplasm</li>
            <li>Nuclei pushed to the cell edge</li>
            <li>Cells packed closely together</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Metacognitive cue:</strong> If you are “just looking,” stop.
            Ask: <em>Why does it look like this?</em>

        <p>
            Drawing forces your brain to encode structure spatially.

    <!-- 6. CONCEPTUAL CHALLENGE -->
    <!-- ========================= -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conceptual Challenge</h2>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong><br>
            Why is adipose tissue well-suited for long-term energy storage rather than quick energy release?
        </p>

        <button onclick="toggle('answer1')">Reveal Explanation</button>
        <div id="answer1" class="hidden">
            <p>
                Fat stores far more energy per gram than carbohydrates. The large lipid droplet
                allows massive energy storage without disrupting cellular processes.
